## 💻 Job & Tech Stack:
- I'm working as a DevOps now. I helped build/configure systems that use big data and require high security, then monitor and maintain them. Even though I still code new features for using services if needed (reading their big codebase is kinda hard though haha), I worked with
  - docker
  - hadoop hdfs, gluster
  - data ETL: airflow, trino, nifi
  - db: mostly postgres
  - monitor: grafana, victoria metrics, prometheus, zabbix
- For side projects:
  - NextJS, Tailwind, Shadcn
  - db: I like Drizzle with Cloud DB, I will try IndexedDB/local storage too + sync of course
  - authentication: clerk for ez use, don't like headedge haha, will try roll my own auth too
  - next-intl for multi-language and currency (for now)
  - payment: lemon squeezy or polar (idk yet)
  - offline mode for page (localfirst build): serwist (maybe, I found it usable)
